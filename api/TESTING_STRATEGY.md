# API Testing Strategy - FSW Iron Task Construction Documentation System

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the FSW Iron Task API, focusing on reliability for construction documentation where downtime or data loss could halt multi-million dollar projects.

## Current State Analysis
- **Test Suites**: 5 existing files
- **Coverage**: 7.93% (critically low)
- **Routes Tested**: 2 out of 20+ route files
- **Critical Gaps**: Media upload, project management, safety/quality endpoints

## Testing Priorities

### 1. Critical Path Testing (Priority 1)
- **Authentication System**: Login, registration, token refresh, session management
- **Media Upload**: Photo/video uploads, batch processing, file validation
- **Project Management**: Creation, updates, team assignment, access control
- **Safety/Quality**: Inspection forms, compliance tracking, incident reporting

### 2. Integration Workflows (Priority 2)  
- Complete user journey: Register → Login → Project Access → Media Upload → Report Generation
- Real-time features: WebSocket connections, notifications, live updates
- File processing: Upload → Thumbnail generation → Storage → Access via signed URLs

### 3. Security & Edge Cases (Priority 3)
- Rate limiting enforcement
- Input validation and sanitization  
- File upload security (malicious files, size limits)
- Access control validation
- Error handling scenarios

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- **Services**: Business logic, data validation, file processing
- **Utilities**: Error handling, logging, helper functions
- **Middleware**: Authentication, validation, rate limiting

### Integration Tests  
- **API Routes**: Full request/response cycle with mocked dependencies
- **Database Operations**: CRUD operations with test database
- **File Operations**: Upload, processing, storage with mocked S3

### End-to-End Tests
- **Complete Workflows**: Multi-step user journeys
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket connections and broadcasting
- **Performance**: Load testing critical endpoints

## Test Data Management

### Test Database Strategy
- Isolated test database per test suite
- Transaction rollback after each test
- Seed data for consistent test scenarios
- Factory functions for generating test data

### Mock Strategy
- **External Services**: S3, email, push notifications
- **Database**: Prisma client mocking for unit tests
- **Authentication**: JWT token generation/validation
- **File System**: Mock file operations

## Performance & Load Testing

### Critical Endpoints
- `/auth/login` - 100 concurrent users
- `/media/upload` - 50 concurrent uploads (10MB files)
- `/projects` - Complex queries with joins
- WebSocket connections - 200 concurrent users

### Metrics to Track
- Response times (95th percentile < 500ms)
- Memory usage during file uploads
- Database connection pool utilization
- Error rates under load

## Security Testing

### Authentication Security
- Brute force protection (rate limiting)
- Token expiration handling
- Session hijacking prevention
- Password strength validation

### File Upload Security  
- Malicious file detection
- File size limits (100MB max per file)
- File type validation
- Path traversal prevention

### Input Validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- JSON payload size limits

## Test Environment Setup

### Development
- In-memory database for fast execution
- Mocked external services
- Console logging for debugging

### CI/CD
- Docker-based test environment
- Real PostgreSQL instance
- Coverage reporting
- Parallel test execution

## Coverage Goals

### Target Coverage by Component
- **Routes**: 90% line coverage
- **Services**: 95% line coverage  
- **Middleware**: 85% line coverage
- **Utilities**: 90% line coverage

### Critical Business Logic
- Authentication flows: 100%
- Media upload processing: 95%
- Project access control: 100%
- Safety/quality workflows: 90%

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Enhanced test utilities and helpers
2. Mock factories and test data generators
3. Database test setup and cleanup
4. Test environment configuration

### Phase 2: Core Routes (Week 2-3)
1. Authentication route tests (expand existing)
2. Media upload route tests
3. Project management route tests  
4. User management route tests

### Phase 3: Specialized Routes (Week 4)
1. Safety/quality route tests
2. Reports route tests
3. Real-time feature tests
4. Dashboard and analytics tests

### Phase 4: Integration & Performance (Week 5)
1. End-to-end workflow tests
2. Performance and load testing
3. Security vulnerability testing
4. CI/CD integration

## Tools & Libraries

### Core Testing Stack
- **Jest**: Test runner and assertion library
- **Supertest**: HTTP assertion library
- **@databases/pg-test**: Isolated test databases
- **MSW**: API mocking for external services

### Performance Testing
- **Artillery**: Load testing tool
- **Clinic.js**: Performance profiling
- **0x**: CPU profiling

### Security Testing
- **OWASP ZAP**: Vulnerability scanning
- **SQLMap**: SQL injection testing
- **Custom scripts**: Rate limiting, auth bypass testing

## Monitoring & Reporting

### Test Metrics
- Code coverage reports (detailed by component)
- Test execution time tracking
- Flaky test identification
- Security test results

### Quality Gates
- Minimum 85% code coverage for CI/CD
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- All integration tests passing
- Performance benchmarks met

## Maintenance

### Test Maintenance
- Regular test data updates
- Mock service updates
- Performance baseline updates
- Security test scenario updates

### Documentation
- Test case documentation
- Mock service documentation
- Performance benchmark documentation
- Security testing procedures

This strategy ensures rock-solid reliability for the construction documentation system, preventing costly downtime and data loss that could impact multi-million dollar projects.
